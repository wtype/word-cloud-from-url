# Web Page to Word Cloud

Generate a word cloud image from a url using Python.

There are lots of free word cloud generators online. I tried to use one recently and was met with a barrage of popups asking me to "OK" cookies and warnings that "We may sell data to advertisers".

I'm not keen on simple services that ask so much, so here's a quick script to make your own word cloud images for free.

## Build A Word Cloud

```
git clone https://github.com/wtype/word-cloud-from-url.git

cd word-cloud-from-url

python cloud.py
```

Enter your `url` and press enter.
